  a data model representing the fields to lint and what to lint them for

  the 'warning' severity are usability issues, they aren't breaking, but they make your documentation harder to use

  the first segment is the requirement, length or (not) missing
  the second segment is the path to the field with the requirement
  elements on the path that are in BOLD are user defined in the swagger file
  requirements::buildObjectNavigationMap to map these to the key-names used in the actual swagger file
